Executive Summary

This proposal aims to enhance the marketing efforts of Qubic. There is Mooning agency, which is funded and set to take over social media and creative work. Jen King currently takes care of blog, press releases, and general website updates.

To this end, Retrodrive requests $5,000 monthly payment and Broms requests $4,000 monthly payment to supercharge and expand the marketing of Qubic. The goal is to leverage the newly funded marketing agency, existing funded efforts, Qubic workgroups, and community contributors to maximize the impact of Qubic campaigns without incurring any additional or unnecessary expenses.

Additionally produce high-quality, handmade content and media with deliverables listed below.

By building on our funded initiatives, rather than duplicating effort, we’ll maximize reach and drive measurable growth without extra overhead.

Current Situation

Qubic’s X account, a vital channel for community engagement and brand visibility, has faced a consistent decline in activity and impact due to recent marketing team member changes and funding constraints.

An Australian agency, “Mooning,” has been onboarded and paid to take over Qubic’s social media presence for next 3 months. They are committed to daily management and two-week sprints, delivering 50-60 new content posts per month with full reporting responsibility.
 Additionally, Jen will execute bi-weekly PR campaigns, similar to the Monero mining announcement on Monday, June 09, 2025.

However, a significant challenge remains: any agency, including Mooning, requires substantial time and effort to fully grasp the concept of Qubic ecosystem, community, messaging, and values. This lack of in-depth project knowledge is a common concern when outsourcing to external teams. I believe Mooning’s efforts would greatly benefit from the support of highly experienced members of the community with strong relationships with peers and a deep understanding of Qubic.

Initiative Leads and Responsibilities

Retrodrive – Longtime community member and Ambassador lead for the US. Known for delivering complex concepts in simple terms through YouTube videos and X posts. Partially contributed to the main X account in the past during team transition with highest conversion statistics.
 Responsible for expanding the content of the current marketing initiatives. Deliverables listed below.

Broms – One of the most involved members of Qubic community since 2023, with in-depth knowledge of the protocol and strong relations with members of the Qubic Community. With him and Mooning agency residing in Australia he is the perfect candidate to support their marketing efforts.
 Responsible for all management tasks between the agency, workgroups and internal Qubic teams.

Deliverables

On top of the support our team’s deliverables will include:

Daily Engagement: Regularly publish high-quality posts on the main Qubic X account to maintain consistent visibility and community interaction.
  Ex:

Weekly Series: Develop several unique weekly ongoing content series, including but not limited to:

Custom Mining Updates: Insights into mining developments such as full weekly Monero mining statistics.
  Ex1:  Ex2:

Teams Updates: Highlights of Qubic’s technological and ecosystem advancements and roadmap progress.

AMA Summaries: Concise, engaging recaps of Ask Me Anything sessions to inform and excite the community.
  Ex1:  Ex2.

Video Content: Produce 2 professional videos per month about Qubic, showcasing key features, how-to guidance, and ecosystem benefits to enhance reach and appeal. Specifically the content may include any of the following: interviews, tokenomics, halving, poc, mining, how quorum works, AIGarth use cases, oracle machines, Qubic vs Tao, Qx exchange, Random smart contract, new SCs launching on-chain etc.
  Ex:

Content Sourcing & Verification: Collaborate closely with the Qubic teams, ambassadors, and workgroups to source accurate information and confirm all posted content for reliability and alignment with project goals.

Drive New Initiatives: Help create visibility and streamline accessibility to Qubic. Some of the initiatives include but not limited to: Planned expansion of Qubic Merch store, planned launch of Qubic branded prebuilt mining rigs, engagement with select YouTube channel etc.

We are uniquely positioned to verify, manage, and deliver on this marketing effort due to:

Active Content Contribution: Physically create and deliver high-quality, hand-made content, retaining full control over on-time delivery.

Proven Track Record: Strong, positive history of successful Qubic marketing contributions including Qubic’s main X account.

Ecosystem Expertise: Team possesses thorough knowledge of the Qubic ecosystem, from technology to community dynamics, enabling targeted messaging.

Narrative Leadership: The content, including written materials, X posts, and YouTube videos, consistently shape and lead the general narrative around Qubic.

Rigorous Research: We uphold high standards of research and content verification to ensure accuracy and credibility in all communications.

Close Collaboration: We work directly with Qubic workgroups, ambassadors, and other various Qubic initiatives to align messaging with project goals and technical realities.

High Conversion Rates: X posts have demonstrated some of the highest conversion rates in Qubic, effectively turning engagement into community growth and interest.

Conclusion

This proposal leverages currently budgeted and allocated resources, offering a low-cost, high-impact solution to enhance Qubic’s marketing efforts. Funding will support content creation, video production, research by Retrodrive, and management services by Broms.

Any additional funding requests, which can enhance marketing, and visibility may be submitted separately to enhance transparency and governance.

By combining our expertise and direct involvement with Jen’s and Mooning’s efforts, we can rejuvenate Qubic’s presence, strengthen community trust, and drive growth. We respectfully request your support to fund this initiative. For questions or further discussion, please post in the discussion thread.
