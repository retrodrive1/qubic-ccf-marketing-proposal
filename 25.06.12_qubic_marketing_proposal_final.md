## Executive Summary

This proposal aims to enhance the marketing efforts of Qubic. There is Mooning agency, which is funded and set to take over social media and creative work. Jen King currently takes care of blog, press releases, and general website updates.

To this end, Retrodrive requests $5,000 monthly payment and Broms requests $4,000 monthly payment to supercharge and expand the marketing of Qubic. The goal is to leverage the newly funded marketing agency, existing funded efforts, Qubic workgroups, and community contributors to maximize the impact of Qubic campaigns without incurring any additional or unnecessary expenses.

Additionally produce high-quality, handmade content and media with deliverables listed below.

By building on our funded initiatives, rather than duplicating effort, we’ll maximize reach and drive measurable growth without extra overhead.

## Current Situation

Qubic’s X account, a vital channel for community engagement and brand visibility, has faced a consistent decline in activity and impact due to recent marketing team member changes and funding constraints.

An Australian agency, “Mooning,” has been onboarded and paid to take over Qubic’s social media presence for next 3 months. They are committed to daily management and two-week sprints, delivering 50-60 new content posts per month with full reporting responsibility.

Additionally, Jen will execute bi-weekly PR campaigns, similar to the Monero mining announcement on Monday, June 09, 2025.

However, a significant challenge remains: any agency, including Mooning, requires substantial time and effort to fully grasp the concept of Qubic ecosystem, community, messaging, and values. This lack of in-depth project knowledge is a common concern when outsourcing to external teams. I believe Mooning’s efforts would greatly benefit from the support of highly experienced members of the community with strong relationships with peers and a deep understanding of Qubic.
